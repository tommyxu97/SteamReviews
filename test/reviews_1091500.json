FPS will just dip to 40 \nFist fighting in the game... what the hell is this...\nThe game has a dodge system... and as they punch they glue to you?  i dodge and its almost like mini teleports, the punch/kick still lands... it is so incredibly stupid.\n\n So ok, you need to time the punches and kicks to somehow counter / dodge. This completely makes sense... but their fighting makes no sense... its a heavy punch so they go in slow motion. It looks so dumb but you need to wait and watch this stupid slow punch and try to time it. Then a quick punch which almost looks the same.  Even with lots of practice,  and you begin to memorise the terrible movements this game has, the fking snap teleporting as you dodge making the punch / kick still land is so incredibly dumb.\n\nPerhaps in the future the game will have improvements making it playable, i don't know. \nI just don't see the point right now. Everything is so bloody choppy with low crowd density and medium to low settings.  \n\nQuests often make no sense... but i could fix that with google. \n\nThe yellow dot path system to reach your destination is trash. Unless its suppose to take you to the building and you have to figure where to go to get in. \n\nI'm still near the start of the game and they want me to fight the 2 twins at once. It's so unbelievably bad its laughable. The moment you start punching the other one does the fking slingshot teleporting which can't be dodged and if you aren't perfect and they get some hits in... your health drops fast.\n\nFix your damn game performance stability\nFix your fighting system... they shouldn't slingshot to you as you dodge... how is this suppose to make sense. If i'm out of range then a punch/kick SHOULD NOT LAND... I get i predodged and you don't like that... fking slingshotting them to me as punishment is very childish on your part... very lazy...\n\nSteam needs a 1-5 star system because this game needs 1 star not just a yes or no", "timestamp_created": 1610783732, "timestamp_updated": 1610783732, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "84774442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009177904", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 791, "playtime_at_review": 2645, "last_played": 1610784333}, "language": "english", "review": "Released way too early.

delayed.  There are bugs, but they aren't that terrible in my experience.  I have a pretty old computer at this point, almost 6 years old.  NPC's are a backdrop and they arent perfect, but they serve their purpose.  Cops don't chance fully, but I expect to see this more.  These things were really irrelevant to me.  \n\nThe story has so much heart and love poured into it.  One of the storylines I played through, I was being a completionist of sorts to do it.  However, it ended up being great and one of my favorites.  The game is good,  and so immersive.  There are things to find EVERYWHERE in the game.  Not every corner has something interesting, but looking in them is not disappointing.  There are things to find, and when you do its just great.\n\nAnyways - I reccomend the game.

This game got released WAY too early. IMHO they should`ve scratched the PS4/Xbox One versions entirely, as this hurt every other platform release.\nUnfinished gameplay systems (AI of the Gangs is non-existent, no real AI for the cops (really, they just don`t give a shit about anything you do). Also, what`s up with the whole monorail stuff you could see in the trailers? It`s unfinished, no monorail for you.\nAnd don`t get me started on the whole \"garbage collection\" stuff. If I walk 10 meters, turn around and can see 5 NPC`s, be assured if I turn around, walk 10 meters and turn around AGAIN, there will be 5 whole new NPC`s with no trace of the other 5 guys/gals.\nDriving your car feels so bad that I honestly ended up most of the time running and jumping through Night City (which is unbelievably good looking!)\nAnother thing is the quest design. It just really doesn`t matter in 90% of the quests how you approach them. Dialogue options don`t do jack shit most of the time and don`t change the outcome of most quests.\n\nDon`t get me wrong, this is a good game all in all. But CD Projekt Red messed up big this time, just to grab the christmas sales. We`ll see if the planned Patches and \"Free DLC`s\" (which means delivering content that should`ve been in the base game) will fix this game.\n\nFor now: stay away, don`t buy.", "timestamp_created": 1610779079, "timestamp_updated": 1610779211, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476377934217453003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "84771957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198915336156", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1610779357}, "language": "english", "review": "game has yet to get past the launch screen before crashing despite several attempts to re-install", "timestamp_created": 1610779063, "timestamp_updated": 1610779063, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "84771904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031542625", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2138, "playtime_at_review": 2138, "last_played": 1610778679}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0413\u0422\u0410 !
